1. Holes and slots positioned too close to bends

Holes and slots which are located close to bends are susceptible to deforming following bending. To ensure successful bending, it is recommended to place holes away from bends at a distance of at least 2.5 times the material's thickness (T) plus the bend radius (R). For slots, it is recommended to position it at least 4 times the material's thickness plus the bend radius away from the bend.

Minimum recommended hole edge from bend face = 2.5T + R  
Minimum recommended slot edge from bend face = 4T + R

2. Holes and slots positioned too close to edge

Holes and slots located too near a part edge can result in a "bulging" effect. Therefore, a good rule of thumb is to leave a minimum space of at least 2 times the thickness of the sheet between the extruded holes and the part edge.
